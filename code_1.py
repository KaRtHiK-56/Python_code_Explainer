Code snippet 1: 
def fibonacciSeries(i):
	    if i < = 1:
		    return i
	    else:
		    return (fibonacciSeries(i - 1) + fibonacciSeries(i - 2))
    num=10
    for i in range(num):
	    print(fibonacciSeries(i), end=" ")

Output : if i = 5 
0 1 1 2 3

Algorithm :
Add integer value to num.
Then run a for loop where i is from range 0 to num.
In each iteration print and call the fibonacciSeries function with i as a parameter.
In the Recursive function fibonacciSeries,
Check if i <= 1, if it is True then return i
Else return fibonacci(i - 1) + fibonacci(i - 2).


Code snippet 2: 
def modify_list(input_list):
  input_list.append(4)
  input_list = [1,2,3]
my_list = [0]
modify_list(my_list)
print(my_list)

Output : [0, 4]

Algorithm :
Inside the modify_list function, an element 4 is appended to input_list.
Then, input_list is reassigned to a new list [1,2,3], but this change doesn't affeact the original list.
So, print(my_list) outputs [0, 4].
